# Liu_An-Chaochao_Li_AV_App

## Project Title

Audio/Video App  --- This project will build an audio/video app by using queries and database assets. 

Based on Roku Flashback, able to log in, select movies, tv show or audio based on user
profile (adult or kids), and build an API that will let a user comment on the
selection, rate it, and share via social media. 

For now, we focus on creating the correct app structure
with some tooling in place (Gulp, SASS etc).

In the future, we will update more function to Audio/Video App.
